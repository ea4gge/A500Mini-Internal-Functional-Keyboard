This is project of the A500Mini internal functional keyboard, based in 32U4 processor (Arduino leonardo, for example).


Actually it is working as final release, feel free to use, modify, recreate, ...

# The features:

1.- HID internal fully functional keyboard, with F12 key in the "eject" button of the disk drive, CAPS Lock led, ...

2.- Internal 4 USB's HUB: One for the keyboard, one for the SD reader, one internal free (for network, for example) tha last one for the rear original placed USB on the main unit (because one of the original populated USB must be used por the hub's imput)

3.- SD card's reader exactly in the floppy disk's place.

4.- A lot of smiles after the fabrication :D 

The readme file and the help file for the fabrication is WIP at the moment.

All the mechanical procedures are made by Kikems_Retro.

The presentation of the first prototype  (one weekend JOB) was in the youtube's AmigaWave program. We have also presented in the "Posadas party", in Spain 

The inspiration for my own code was from the "Armapad36v2" because is my firstt program of an USB Keyboard. Many thanks for the Author of this!!!

Spetial thanks to EA4EOZ. He has had the idea of use the Eject button and gave me a lot of help in the code of the Arduino
