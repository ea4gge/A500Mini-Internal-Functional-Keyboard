This is the Ongoing project of the A500Mini internal functional keyboard based in 32U4 processor (Arduino leonardo, for example).


Actually it is working as a Prototype with some pendig things in programation:

1.- No double or triple key is admitted yet  ---> SOLVED

2.- Keypad launch characters but not the keypad keycodes yet ---> SOLVED

At the hardware level the PCB design is ON GOING. -->Done

It will have a fully USB keyboard. Anyway... it will have a secondary board with: --->DONE

- 1 USB 2.0 4 ports Hub. The idea is to use a port of the 3 of the A500 board for the hub's imput, use one port of the hub for to give output to the connector of the port used for the hub imput.
- One SD reader directly in front of the Floppy Disk Drive "input" of the mini
- One port for the keyboard.
- One free port, for Wifi or other porpuses

IN THIS MOMENT THE NEXT STEEP IS TO SEND TO PCBWay THE DESIGN FOR PROTOTYPE BOARDS. Any values of the components are not added yet. I will do during this week


In the Project is also work in progress all the mechanical jobs for to do:

1.- Separate the keys of the original keyboard without damage the keys. Yes, we want to use the originals, not other keys

2.- Align the keycaps with the switches for the final mount

All the mechanical procedures are made by Kikems_Retro.

The presentation of the first prototype  (one weekend JOB) was in the youtube's AmigaWave program this sunday night

The inspiration for my own code was from the "Armapad36v2" because is my firstt program of an USB Keyboard. Many thanks for the Author of this!!!

I'll be updating during the progress

Many thanks to all and Enjoy!!
